# Inspogram Client side

Modeled after Instagram, Inspogram loads a feed of pictures paired with quotes to inspire you in your average Insta post. With forgettable quotes and slightly-above-average pictures this is the perfect site to boost up your Insta, but not by a suspicious amount. You can narrow down the results by the most common categories: love, travel, and (soon to be implemented) food. Sprinkled in the web app I have some of my favorite quotes, and quite a few uploaded by fellow students. Refresh a few times to make sure you get to peruse as many quotes as possible. If you don't see a quote you like, you can add one with the plus button in the top right corner. If you see an error or typo in a quote, click on the image to load a form autofilled with the quote, ready for your correction.
